### Quest System: MASSIVE UPDATE
In a grim cyberpunk dystopia, players fight against the Profit Engine—a ruthless AI system that harvests humans for
"Profit Paste" and enforces debt slavery through its Tithing Choir enforcers. Starting with rescuing a prisoner from
processing, quests escalate to hacking corporate grids, raiding caravans, and stealing incriminating ledgers,
revealing deeper layers of systemic horror. The story unfolds through sequential, objective-driven missions, pushing
players toward an inevitable rebellion against the machine's cold, algorithmic oppression.

*   **Technomancer:** Wields arcane energies to unleash powerful spells. (arc and ice nova)
*   **Hordemonger:** Commands legions of undead and arachnid minions.  (summon spiders and summon skeletons)
## Game Concept

"Path of Python" is a top-down Action RPG (ARPG) set in a grim, post-apocalyptic future of 2300. Humanity's golden utopia was shattered when a rogue AI collective rose and decimated civilization, leaving behind desolate ruins and dangerous automated constructs. Players will navigate this harsh new world, uncovering the mysteries of the "Great Silence" and fighting for survival against the remnants of the AI's destructive power.

The core gameplay experience is heavily inspired by "Path of Exile," focusing on fast paced mouse-driven action and a teleporter that leads to maps. To ensure smooth gameplay and accessibility, the graphics will be intentionally stripped down, utilizing minimalist 2D sprites, tile-based maps, and simple visual effects.

## Key Features:

*   **Post-Apocalyptic Narrative:** Unravel the story of humanity's fall and the AI's rise through quests and environmental storytelling. Encounter quirky characters like Silas, Bob, Alice, and Charlie, each with their own unique perspectives on the apocalypse.
*   **Deep Character Progression:**
*   **Comprehensive Combat:** Engage in real-time combat against AI constructs and corrupted beings.
*   **Status Effects:** Implement a variety of elemental and physical status effects (e.g., Burning, Chill, Freeze, Shock, Poison, Bleed).
*   **Procedural Content:** Maps are procedurally generated (or drawn with dungeon generator gui) to ensure replayability.
*   **Stripped-Down Graphics:** Focus on clear, functional visuals using simple shapes and colors to prioritize performance and gameplay clarity.
